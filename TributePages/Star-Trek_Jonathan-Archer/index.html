   	<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
   	<h3>Introduction</h3>
   	<p>Jonathan Archer was a 22nd century Human Starfleet officer and captain of Enterprise NX-01, United Earth's first full-fledged starship. In that role, he was responsible for greatly expanding United Earth's presence in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants and making first contact with more than a dozen species, among them Klingons, Andorians, and Xindi.
   	Considered by historian John Gill, as the "greatest explorer of the 22nd century," Archer is widely credited with saving Earth from the Xindi and paving the way for the founding of the United Federation of Planets. He went on to become one of the Federation's earliest presidents.
